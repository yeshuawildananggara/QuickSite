# QuickSite 🚀

QuickSite is a simple landing page project that includes a checkout and order flow. The goal of this project is to practice building a complete front-end experience using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project represents my first time publishing a website and managing a real project on GitHub.

## 🔹 What This Project Is

QuickSite is designed as a landing page for a fictional service or product, with additional pages for:

- Landing page (main marketing page)
- Checkout page
- Order/confirmation page

The project focuses on basic UI structure, layout, and user flow from landing to order.

## 🔹 What I Learned

Through this project, I learned and practiced:

- Structuring a multi-page website using HTML
- Styling layouts and components with CSS
- Basic JavaScript for interactivity and page behavior
- Organizing files and folders for a real project
- Uploading and deploying a project to GitHub Pages
- Using Git and GitHub for version control

This helped me understand how a real front-end project is structured from start to finish.

## 🔹 What I’d Improve Next

For future versions, I would like to:

- Improve the UI/UX design for a more professional look
- Make the website fully responsive for mobile devices
- Add better form validation on the checkout page
- Refactor CSS for cleaner and more reusable styles
- Add more advanced JavaScript for better user experience
